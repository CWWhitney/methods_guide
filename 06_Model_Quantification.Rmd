##Model quantification

For final model quantification the analyst converts the conceptual model into a mathematical model, translating stakeholder inputs into equations as accurately as possible. Following @Luedeling_Wajir_2015, all estimates can then be consolidated into one single distribution for each model parameter.

Once completed and verified with the literature and other sources, the BN can be shared with experts again for verifying its logical consistency and receiving final feedback.
